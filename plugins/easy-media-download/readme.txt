=== Embedding Shortcodes for the Downloads ===

Create a new post/page and use the following shortcode to create a download button for your digital media file:

`[easy_media_download url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip"]`

here, url is a shortcode parameter that you need to replace with the actual URL to your digital file

You can also specify additional optional parameters in the shortcode to customize the free download button.

**Button Text**

By default the text for the download button is "Download Now". But you can choose to modify the text using the "text" parameter.

`[easy_media_download url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" text="Free Download"]`

**Button Width**

By default the width for the download button is "153". But you can choose to modify it using the "width" parameter.

`[easy_media_download url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" text="Free Download" width="100"]`

**Button Height**

By default the height for the download button is "41". But you can choose to modify it using the "height" parameter.

`[easy_media_download url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" text="Free Download" width="100" height="50"]`

**Download in a new window**

By default the download starts in the same window. But you can choose to modify it using the "target" parameter.

`[easy_media_download url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" target="_blank"]`  (opens the download in a new window)

=== Force File Download ===

Usually when a digital file is recognised by the browser it does not prompt for download. The file just opens in the browser instead. You can choose to modify this behaviour using the `force_dl` parameter in the shortcode.

`[easy_media_download url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.mp3" force_dl="1"]` 

=== Download Button Templates ===

Easy Media Download comes with 21 different download button templates. All you need to do is specify the style and the button will look just like it. For example:

`[easy_media_download url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" color="red_darker"]`

* grey
* grey_light
* red
* green_dark
* green_light
* green
* blue
* blue_two
* blue_three
* blue_four
* orange
* orange_two
* orange_light
* orange_dark
* purple
* purple_dark
* purple_light
* yellow_red
* hot_pink
* pink

If you want to fully customize the download button you can use your own button image instead.

=== Link Rel ===

You can use the HTML link `rel` attribute in the shortcode to define the relationship between your page and the linked download.

`[easy_media_download url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" rel="nofollow"]`

=== Custom CSS Class ===

In addition to various button templates, If you want to apply custom styling to a button you can do so by using the `class` parameter.

`[easy_media_download url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" class="myclass"]`

You can specify multiple CSS classes in the shortcode.

[easy_media_download url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" class="myclass1 myclass2 myclass3"]

=== Easy Media Download Shortcode 2 ===

With this shortcode, you can create a download button with your preferred color.

`[easy_media_download2 url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" text="Free Download" bg_color="#CC0000"]`

**Background Color**

The background color of the download button is "#3498db" by default. You can customize it using the "bg_color" parameter.

`[easy_media_download2 url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" bg_color="#CC0000"]`

**Font Color**

The font color of the download button is "#ffffff" by default. You can customize it using the "font_color" parameter.

`[easy_media_download2 url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" text="Free Download" font_color="#71B02F"]`

**Hover Background Color**

The "hover_bg_color" parameter can be used to change the background color of the download button when you mouse over it.

[easy_media_download2 url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/myfile.zip" text="Free Download" bg_color="#3498db" hover_bg_color="#3cb0fd"]
